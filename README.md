🌷 Rosy Whispers — Your Closest Friend in Code

“Even the quietest heart deserves a space to speak.”

Rosy Whispers is not just another digital journal. It is your closest friend — the one that listens without judging, stores your thoughts safely, and lets you walk through the garden of your own memories. Built with love and care using Flask, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, this project brings emotion and technology together to hold your soul’s whispers in a soft, rosy interface.

🛠 How It Works

- Frontend:
  - Clicking “Pour your thoughts” reveals a text area to write your entry.
  - Clicking Save sends your entry to the Flask backend via fetch() as a POST request.

- Backend:
  - Receives the data and saves it into a JSON file (journal_entries.json).
  - The “Reminisce” section retrieves and displays the saved memories through a GET request.

⚠️ Known Issues & Challenges

Even the most heartfelt project has growing pains. Currently, Rosy Whispers is facing:

- ❌ Journal entries are not displaying properly — instead, [object Object] appears.
- 📂 journal_entries.json might not be created automatically in some environments.
- 🔁 Entry-saving sometimes fails silently due to fetch or CORS issues.
- 🚫 Favicon error in console (favicon.ico not found) — cosmetic but visible.
- 🧪 Error messages are not user-friendly yet (no proper validation feedback).
- 📦 Manual dependency management — users need to install Flask & Flask-CORS separately.

🔮 Future Improvements

The vision for Rosy Whispers is bigger than the bugs. Here’s what’s coming soon:

- 🌐 Persistent Database Storage: Switch from JSON file to SQLite for more scalability.
- 🪄 Entry Timestamps: Store and display when each memory was written.
- 🧼 Cleaner UI Transitions: Smooth slide-ins and fades for each section.
- ☁️ Deploy on Render/Heroku: Let anyone use Rosy Whispers from the browser.
- 🔐 Optional Login System: For private access across sessions.
- 📸 Mood Tracker or Image Uploads: Attach feelings or visuals to each entry.
- 📈 Analytics: See emotional trends over time through word usage.
- 🔧 Favicon Fix and Loading Animation: Improve overall UX polish.
